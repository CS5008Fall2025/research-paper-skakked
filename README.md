# Research Paper
* Name: Siddharth Kakked
* Semester: Fall 2025
* Topic: Cuckoo Hashing: A Hash Table with Worst-Case Constant Lookup Time

Note the following is an example outline to help you. Please rework as you need, you do not need to follow the section heads and *YOU SHOULD NOT* make everything a bulleted list. This needs to read as an executive report/research paper. 

## Introduction
- What is the algorithm/datastructure?

    - Cuckoo hashing is a hash table that generates O(1) worst-case lookup by giving each key two possible homes instead of one. 

    - Unline traditional hash tables where collsions can create long chains or probe sequences, cuckoo hashing gurantees that any key can be found checking at most two locations.

    - The name derives from the behavior of some species of cuckoo, where the cuckoo chick pushes the other eggs or young out of the nest when it hatches in a variation of the behavior referred to as brood parasitism; analogously, inserting a new key into a cuckoo hashing table may push an older key to a different location in the table.

- What is the problem it solves? 
- Provide a brief history of the algorithm/datastructure. (make sure to cite sources)
- Provide an introduction to the rest of the paper. 


## Analysis of Algorithm/Datastructure
Make sure to include the following:
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- General analysis of the algorithm/datastructure

## Empirical Analysis
- What is the empirical analysis?
- Provide specific examples / data.


## Application
- What is the algorithm/datastructure used for?
- Provide specific examples
- Why is it useful / used in that field area?
- Make sure to provide sources for your information.


## Implementation
- What language did you use?
- What libraries did you use?
- What were the challenges you faced?
- Provide key points of the algorithm/datastructure implementation, discuss the code.
- If you found code in another language, and then implemented in your own language that is fine - but make sure to document that.


## Summary
- Provide a summary of your findings
- What did you learn?
